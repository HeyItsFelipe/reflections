When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I may be out on a trip or other collaborator may want to add his commit to the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I may be working on a new changes or features that not yet ready to be shared, still has bug, etc. If Git automatically pull changes to my local repository then I'll lose my work.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
I can see what updates occur on the remote repository and test them in my machine. I can check whether my work is still compatible with the new updates.
