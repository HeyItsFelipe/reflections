I accidently remove this file in the middle of Lesson 2!!! :(
w can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can check the difference between files in the staging area and those in the working directory or the repository before doing a commit.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches would be helpful if I want to try adding new feature or making changes. Branches help in case these changes are abandoned, the original branch can still progress without it.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
It helps me in which commits commit a branch begin.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
It will combine them together.
